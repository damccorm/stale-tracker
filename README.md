# WIP: stale-tracker
Repo for tracking stale items across GitHub and Azure Pipelines

### Motivation

Right now, I'm involved in several repos across Azure Pipelines and GitHub. This repo is meant to track items that have slipped between the cracks and give me a quick sense of what needs to be addressed.

### Usage

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/damccorm/stale-tracker && cd stale-tracker`
- Define the repositories/contributors you'd like to watch in `config.yml`
- Run `npm bootstrap`
